You (who ever you are) are free to use all this code freely without
even giving creds to us (the creators).

There are two exeptions though.

* The first
If we are not the original creators of the code, for example Modernizer, Bootstrap
or similar.

* The Second
You are a student at the course INFC55 at Lund University 2014.

That is super awesome, yeeey!
